      <h1> About Students for STEM NZ </h1>
      <p> This website was created to address the gender gap in STEM pathways, where women are underrepresented. As a high school girl who is interested in STEM, I wanted to try and help other girls who may feel dissuaded from STEM due to the lack of female representation. Research suggests that one of the ways to inspire young girls to pursue STEM is by exposure to female role models.

        <h2> Did you know? </h2> 
        <p> According to <a href="https://techwomen.nz/get-informed/">techwomen.nz</a>, “Less than 1 in 20 girls considers a high-paid career in science, technology, engineering or maths, compared to 1 in 5 boys.” And in a <a href="https://www.aut.ac.nz/news/opinion/promoting-equality-in-the-future-of-tech">news article</a> for Auckland University of Technology, Mahsa Mohaghegh, computer scientist and founder of SheSharp, says that “One of the most effective ways to promote and encourage more girls to consider tech as a career path is to highlight female role models in these fields – women who our next generation of girls can aspire to be like.”
