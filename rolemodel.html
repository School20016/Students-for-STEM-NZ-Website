Try it, you might not like it, so try something else. If you don’t try it you don’t know. And find other females around you who are also into this stuff, maybe in New Zealand, maybe offshore because doing it as a group actually is a really great way to provide mentorship, get mentorship and work together as a team.” - Michelle Dickinson
